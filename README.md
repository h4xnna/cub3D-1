# cub3D 🏰

A pseudo-3D rendering engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, built in C as part of the 42 school curriculum. The project implements a **raycasting** algorithm to display a 3D-looking environment from a 2D map, complete with textures, colors, and player movement.

## 🧭 Overview

cub3D renders a first-person view of a maze defined in a `.cub` configuration file. The rendering relies on a raycasting algorithm that casts rays from the player's position to compute the distance to walls and determine the height of the walls drawn on screen, creating the illusion of a 3D environment from a purely 2D map.

## ✨ Features

- Real-time rendering via raycasting
- Different wall textures depending on orientation (north, south, east, west)
- Customizable floor and ceiling colors
- Smooth player movement and rotation
- Mouse look support (bonus)
- Full parsing and validation of `.cub` map files
- Map closure check (flood fill)
- Clean program exit (memory freeing, window closing)

## 🔧 Requirements

The project was developed and tested on **Linux**. The following dependencies are needed:

- A C compiler (`cc` / `gcc`)
- `make`
- `git` (to automatically clone MiniLibX)
- X11 development libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libx11-dev libbsd-dev
```

> MiniLibX is automatically cloned and compiled by the Makefile — no manual setup required.

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url> cub3D
cd cub3D
make
```

The Makefile will automatically:
1. Clone MiniLibX if it isn't already present
2. Compile MiniLibX
3. Compile libft
4. Compile the project and generate the `cub3D` executable

## 🚀 Usage

Run the program with a `.cub` map file as argument:

```bash
./cub3D assets/maps/map.cub
```

If the file is invalid (unclosed map, missing textures, wrong characters, etc.), a clear error message is printed to the terminal.

## 🕹️ Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `W` | Move forward |
| `S` | Move backward |
| `A` | Strafe left |
| `D` | Strafe right |
| `←` (left arrow) | Rotate camera left |
| `→` (right arrow) | Rotate camera right |
| Mouse movement | Look around (bonus) |
| `ESC` | Quit the program |
| Window close button | Quit the program |

## 🗺️ Map file format (.cub)

A `.cub` file must contain, in any order, before the map itself:

```
NO ./assets/textures/north.xpm
SO ./assets/textures/south.xpm
WE ./assets/textures/west.xpm
EA ./assets/textures/east.xpm
F 220,100,0
C 225,30,0
```

- `NO`, `SO`, `WE`, `EA`: paths to the wall textures (north, south, west, east)
- `F`: floor color in R,G,B format
- `C`: ceiling color in R,G,B format

Followed by the map itself, made up of:
- `1`: wall
- `0`: empty space
- `N`, `S`, `E`, `W`: player's starting position and orientation
- ` ` (space): allowed only inside the map (not as a border, unless the map is otherwise enclosed by walls)

**Full example:**

```
NO ./assets/textures/north.xpm
SO ./assets/textures/south.xpm
WE ./assets/textures/west.xpm
EA ./assets/textures/east.xpm
F 220,100,0
C 225,30,0

111111
100001
1001N1
100001
111111
```

> ⚠️ The map must be fully enclosed by walls, otherwise the program will refuse to launch.
